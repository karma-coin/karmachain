The FRAME development environment provides modulesâ€”called pallets and support libraries that you can use, modify, and extend to build the runtime logic to suit the needs of your blockchain.

Pallet is a pre-built module that developers can use to extend the functionality of their custom blockchain networks. Pallets are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing developers to easily add specific features or functions to their blockchain networks without having to build everything from scratch.

Pallet can store some data on chain and provide exctinsics (transaction) to mutate blockchain state.
